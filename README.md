ðŸ“š Summary

The association between long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) and core-collapse supernovae (SNe) has been well established since the discovery of SN 1998bw, linked to GRB 980425.
However, recent observations, including GRB 211211A and GRB 230307A, show kilonova-like features, suggesting alternative progenitor channels.
In our study, we present a comparative statistical analysis of two distinct LGRB populations:

LGRBs with confirmed SN associations

LGRBs without observed SN associations

We analyze their prompt emission properties, host galaxy environments, and event rates.
While many properties overlap, a key finding is that the event rates differ significantly.
LGRBs without SN associations follow the cosmic star formation rate more closely, implying that they may represent a distinct progenitor population, possibly involving compact binary mergers rather than core-collapse supernovae.

To facilitate data access and reuse, we provide .txt versions of all five tables included in the paper. Each file corresponds to one table and preserves the original structure for easy parsing.

Table1.txt â€“ Key parameters of the SN-GRBs.

Table2.txt â€“ Prompt emission parameters of SN-less GRBs before Swif t launch.

Table3.txt â€“ Prompt emission parameters of SN-less Swift GRBs.

Table4.txt â€“ Host galaxy properties of SN-less GRBs.

Table5.txt â€“ Parameters of supernovae.
